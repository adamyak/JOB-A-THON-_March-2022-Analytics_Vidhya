## Data Description
ID = Unique Identifier of a row  Age = Age of the customer  Gender = Gender of the customer (Male and Female)  Income = Yearly income of the customer  Balance = Average quarterly balance of the customer  Vintage = No. of years the customer is associated with bank  Transaction_Status = Whether the customer has done any transaction in the past 3 months or not  Product_Holdings = No. of product holdings with the bank  Credit_Card = Whether the customer has a credit card or not  Credit_Category = Category of a customer based on the credit score  Is_Churn = Whether the customer will churn in next 6 months or not

## Problem
 ##### Analyze the  data of a customer and predict whether the customer will churn or not in the future.
 #
## Model Used
 ##### Of all the models, I have used Complement Naive bayes as it gave the F1 score = 0.5919506990 and Accuracy = 0.69
 #
### Model when trained with 40% Test Data
 ##### First Ranker F1 Score= 0.6249118684
 ##### My F1 Score = 0.5919506990
 #
### Model when trained with 100% Test Data
 ##### First Ranker F1 Score= 0.5886851198
 ##### My F1 Score = 0.5830880813 (18th Rank)

### So there is only 1% decrease when Test Data is increased.
